# Project: Cryptocurrency Seniment Analysis

## Project Description
This project involved the analysis of data related to cryptocurrencies sourced from a Telegram channel. Our main goal was to gain a better understanding of various aspects of cryptocurrencies. We utilized Git as a version control tool throughout the project's development. In this project, we made an effort to implement all the commands and instructional steps provided in the training to enhance our skills.

## Version Control with Git
We employed Git as a version control tool for managing the project's source code. Git allowed us to easily track changes in the project and leverage the benefits of version control.

## Commits
During the course of the project, we made more than 20 meaningful commits. Each commit represented a specific event in the project's development, such as the implementation of new features or bug fixes.

## Branches
We utilized three meaningful branches to organize development tasks. The main branch (main) served as the primary development branch, while two other branches named new-feature and other-coins were created for specific purposes.

## Resolving Conflicts
We encountered two conflicts (conflicts) during the project. One occurred when merging changes into the main branch, and the other happened when merging changes from the new-feature branch into the main branch. Resolving these conflicts was most successful when using Git tools and code editors. Below, you can see two different approaches to resolving conflicts:

## Branch Protection
To enhance code quality and streamline development, we protected the main branch (main) on the GitHub repository. This means that merging another branch into the main branch requires the submission of a pull request. This step ensures that changes are thoroughly reviewed and agreed upon before merging branches.

## Gitignore
We have included a Gitignore file as requested. This file prevents unnecessary files from being committed to Git. For instance, outputs like images or files that have no need to be shared in Git, are excluded. Additionally, for our project, .ipynb_checkpoints are not uploaded to GitHub, as shown below:
